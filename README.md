## 🔍 **Key Insights**  

### 💰 **Price Trends & Influencing Factors**  
- **🏠 Location plays a significant role** in property prices. Prime areas like Indiranagar, Koramangala, and Whitefield have the highest rates.  
- **📏 Larger properties (higher square footage) don’t always mean higher prices**, as locality and demand also impact rates.  

### 📊 **Impact of Amenities & BHK**  
- **🛏️ 2BHK and 3BHK properties are the most common**, with **3BHK having higher average prices**.  
- **🏗️ The presence of amenities like parking, lifts, and security increases property value.**  

### 📉 **Market Trends & Predictions**  
- **🔼 The real estate market shows an upward trend** in well-connected localities with good infrastructure.  
- **📉 Some areas are overpriced** compared to actual demand, leading to stagnation in property sales.
